#### Civic Data Alliance <a id="civic-data-alliance"></a>

Founded in 2014, the [Civic Data Alliance](https://www.civicdataalliance.org) \(CDA\) is Louisvilleâ€™s civic tech nonprofit and we are committed to transparent, accessible, and open data and technology.

We create and facilitate innovative solutions to public problems through collaborative hackathons, coding education, and accessible civic engagement.

We are the publicâ€™s voice for open data. We advocate for, make use of, improve upon, centralize, facilitate understanding of, and report on, public data.
