I. Legal Entity Overview:  
II. Civic Data Alliance Project Based Philosophy:  
 The Civic Data Alliance \(CDA\) is focused on advocating for inclusion, diversity, equity, accessibility, openness and transparency in civic tech and open data, interested in liberating, improving, gathering, defining, and reporting on public data and the state of civic tech, while fostering an inclusive, diverse, equitable and accessible civic tech community.

III. Core Membership:

1. Purpose:  The Civic Data Alliance Core Membership will actively work on providing and fostering an equitable, inclusive, diverse, accessible, supportive and safe environment for the creation of projects, creation of space to share knowledge and volunteer engagement.

The Civic Data Alliance Core Membership will operate on the assumption that activities and events will be activated on an as needed basis. The group will come to a consensus regarding what activities will need additional support outside of the HackTheVille hacknight program by reinforcing the volunteer project intake and proposal process.

The Core Membership of the Civic Data Alliance shall seek to build and maintain relationships with our community, citizens, municipal partners, and local governments as long as these relationships do not come at the expense of the organization’s independence and ethics.

The Civic Data Alliance Core Membership commits to creating an equitable, inclusive, diverse, accessible and safe Brigade community by developing governance which strives to support and amplify the voices of traditionally marginalized groups, the community members and shared leadership.

* Core Membership Leadership Committee
* Number of core members
* Max number of Core Members is 21
* Alternates cannot vote
* A minimum of 4 additional Core Members who  are voted in by 3/4ths majority of existing core members.
* Core Membership must always have an odd number of members

Core Membership Member Roles and Voting  
 All Core Membership Leaders must be active in Civic Data Alliance activities: making maximum effort to attend HackTheVille nights and participating in projects, securing event space, securing sponsorships, events and/or development and marketing activities.

* Promotes best practices in the development cycle.
* Recruits new developers for projects.

* Stores and maintains the Civic Data Alliance brand repo and guidelines and provides assets as needed.
* All public-facing communications should be run thru the approval process on github and Buffer

Community Organizer

* Responsible for recruiting and welcoming new members \(brief intro + Slack/tools integration\) and helping them explore opportunities to join a team or get started with their own project.
* Volunteer engagement, keeping a database of volunteers and any individual that attends a hack night.  When there isn’t much of that to be done, help with updates to web presence and maybe share some progress externally.
* Metrics: \# return for a second meeting, new projects or project team members, tasks completed / shipped on their first visit

Core Members \(1 vote for each core member\)

* Core members are expected to actively contribute to the growth and mission of the organization and to engage and support the leadership committee as needed.

The CDA Core Membership is charged with maintaining the definition of an active project in a publicly viewable document. Core Members are responsible for checking the private core slack channel to keep up with all org announcements and events. All info is posted in the private Slack channel prior to publicizing, however, the onus is on the individual Core Members to avail themselves of the information in a timely fashion or forfeit their input.

In other words, those who show up make the decisions.

VII. Code of Conduct Ombudspeople  
 The Civic Data Alliance Code of Conduct provides a mechanism for reporting violations of the Code. To ensure that people are comfortable reporting violations, even if the violation is caused by an action of a member of the Core Membership or event organizers, 2 independent ombudspeople are available to receive complaints.

The Core Membership shall elect 2 members of the Civic Data Alliance community to act as ombudspeople for terms of 2 years.

At least one of the ombudspeople shall not be a member of the Core Membership and must resign this position, if they are elected to a position on the core member. This person may not be an appointed nor elected government official.

The Core Membership shall make a good faith effort to select the ombudspeople to provide the broadest possible diversity as to gender, orientation and race, only selecting those of a non-marginalized group if no one else is available.

The ombudspeople will be identified in the Code of Conduct document and will be the only ones to monitor the [safespace@CivicDataAlliance.org](mailto:safespace@CivicDataAlliance.org) email account.

Complaints may be forwarded directly to an event organizer, Core Membership member or one or the other of the ombudspeople as desired.

The ombudspeople must avoid intervening in cases where they have a beneficial business relationship, friendship or personal relationship with the accuser or accused. They should handle the issue in accordance with the code of conduct or refer it to members of the Core Membership, maintaining any confidentiality requested by the complainant. Any decision to ask someone to leave the organization must be approved by the Core Membership.  
 Violation of \#6 by an ombudsperson would be grounds for immediate removal. Removal of someone from the ombudsperson position requires a ¾ vote of the Core Membership.

Complaints shall be process according to the Code of Conduct Process and Ombudsperson Role. \(This process is pending final approval by the Core Membership.\)
